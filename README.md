<b><h3>Sentiment Analysis and Review Prediction on Restaurant Reviews</h3></b>

<b>Project Overview</b>

This repository contains a project focused on analyzing and visualizing sentiment patterns in restaurant reviews to understand public opinion and attitudes. Additionally, a predictive model is built to classify reviews as either good (1) or bad (0) based on their content.

<b>Datasets</b>
<b>Restaurant Reviews Dataset</b>

This dataset contains reviews of various restaurants, including text reviews and ratings. The goal is to analyze the sentiment expressed in these reviews and visualize patterns to gauge public opinions about different restaurants.

<b>Fresh Reviews Dataset</b>

In addition to sentiment analysis, a predictive model is created to classify reviews as good or bad. The dataset includes fresh reviews for training the model, with the target variable indicating the sentiment (good or bad).

<b>Sentiment Analysis</b>

The sentiment analysis involves:

- Preprocessing the review text, including tokenization and removing stop words.
- Performing sentiment analysis to classify the reviews into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments.
- Visualizing sentiment patterns and trends across different restaurants or topics.

<b>Review Prediction</b>

For the review prediction model:

- Data preprocessing includes cleaning and encoding the review text.
- A classification model is trained to predict whether a review is good (1) or bad (0).
- Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

<b>Results</b>
The analysis provides insights into:

- Sentiment patterns in restaurant reviews, including how opinions vary across different restaurants.
- The effectiveness of the predictive model in classifying reviews as good or bad.
